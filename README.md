Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

## Introduction

This programme is just the simple implementation of grade-school classic "Rock Paper Scissors". For now, 11/11/2022, the basic mechanism of the game is written in script.js and works only in the console.

## Rock Paper Scissors mechanism

Here are the rules of the game: rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper and paper wins against rock.
Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock.
Like a circle of elements.

### The mechanism of the main programme

Three basic mechanisms are to get the player's option, to let computer randomly make choice and to check who is the winner.
