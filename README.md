Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

## Introduction

This programme is just the simple implementation of grade-school classic "Rock Paper Scissors". For now, 11/11/2022, the basic mechanism of the game is written in script.js and works only in the console.

## Rock Paper Scissors mechanism

Here are the rules of the game: rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper and paper wins against rock.
Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock.
Like a circle of elements.

### The mechanism of the main programme

Three basic mechanisms are to get the player's option, to let computer randomly make choice and to check who is the winner.

When the game starts, it will prompt user to get how many rounds does the use want to play. Then the programme will once again ask for player's selection. After making its own decision, the programme will check whether the player is winner or not. The programme will keep track of the results from all rounds.
