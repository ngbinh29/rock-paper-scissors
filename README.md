Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project

## Introduction


This programme is just the simple implementation of grade-school classic "Rock Paper Scissors". For now, 11/11/2022, the basic mechanism of the game is written in script.js and works only in the console.

## Rock Paper Scissors mechanism


Here are the rules of the game: rock wins against scissors, scissors wins against paper and paper wins against rock.
Rock > Scissors > Paper > Rock.
Like a circle of elements.

### The mechanism of the main programme


Three basic mechanisms are to get the player's option, to let computer randomly make choice and to check who is the winner.

When the game starts, it will prompt user to get how many rounds does the use want to play. Then the programme will once again ask for player's selection. After making its own decision, the programme will check whether the player is winner or not. The programme will keep track of the results from all rounds.

## The UI/UX


The concept of the webpage is that it allows users to simply interact with the page and easily understand what it does (Simplicity and Minimalism). To be specific, all you have to do is to play against the computer (RNG) and the page will keep track of the scores.

Whoever get 5 scores first, it is the winner. By clicking on the buttons on the page, three buttons carry the selection and have distinctive colors.

The page is divided into two sections, the left one is displaying the score of player and the other one is of computer.

I intended to make each section change its color based on the selections. However, I have not found out the way to implement it.

### Comments on UI/UX


The color theme might be too bright to human eyes for long-time exposure. Some text seems to be a bit out of position, it is far up to the top of page.

Buttons for selections should be bigger for catching the focus of user.
